# Getting Started

**High-level HiRedis Wrapper**

Redox is a lightweight wrapper over the C-based [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis) library, implemented in Zig for projects that require direct Redis access with minimal overhead and thread safety.

If you need more functionality or code coverage, Please create an issue at [**Redox Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-blitz/redox) and buy us some coffee.
